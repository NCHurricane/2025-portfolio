    "bio": "Bella Grace is the newest and feistiest member of the NCHurricats family. She loves her pink flamingo toy and will carry it with her all around the house. She is also quite the jumper and loves to jump and twist, attempting to catch cat teasers that CatDad swings around. Much like her namesake, she is very affectionate and loves to get head and belly rubs. She is also quite adventurous and stubborn, often going places she shouldn't and daring us to stop her. The floor swiffer is her mortal enemy and she vows to destroy it at all costs.",
